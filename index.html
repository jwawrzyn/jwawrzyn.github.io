        <h3>Professional</h3>
        <p>
          Allow me to introduce myself—my name is Jenny Wawrzynczak. With over
          15 years of experience as a software developer, I've had the privilege
          of immersing myself in the world of coding and technology. But there's
          more to me than just lines of code and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a young age, I discovered a deep passion for golf, a sport that
          has brought me immeasurable joy throughout my life. Little did I know
          that my journey as a software developer and my love for golf would one
          day intertwine in the most fortuitous way imaginable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I find myself in an incredibly fortunate position, where these
          two worlds collide harmoniously. I am humbled to write software for a
          golf non-profit organization, a role that allows me to combine my
          technical expertise with my unwavering passion for the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having dedicated countless hours to mastering the craft of software
          development, I have honed my skills to deliver innovative solutions
          and push the boundaries of what is possible. But it is my deep-rooted
          love for golf that adds an extra dimension to my work, infusing it
          with purpose and meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every line of code I write carries the potential to empower this golf
          non-profit organization, enabling them to reach new heights and
          enhance the experiences of golfers around the world. It is an
          incredible privilege to contribute to the growth and impact of the
          sport I hold so dear.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey stands as a testament to the remarkable synergy that can be
          found when one's personal and professional passions align. The
          convergence of my software development expertise and my lifelong
          devotion to golf has brought me profound fulfillment and the
          opportunity to make a lasting difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          I invite you to join me on this extraordinary adventure as I continue
          to write the next chapter of my story—an exceptional software
          developer driven by a deep love for golf, poised to create meaningful
          change in the world of technology and the golfing community alike.

        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>
          I love to play with photography, taking many, many, many photos of my
          kid or some of the beautiful places we like to visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always enjoy a good game of golf, and never manage to keep myself
          stocked with books. Always on that search for that next book to read.

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Here are some cool things I've been working on.</p>
        <h3>Experiments</h3>
        <p>
          You'll notice I have a space for experiments. This is where I'll put
          any fun web stuff that I'm playing with. Some of it will be in a
          half-finished state, but hey it's just some fun.
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          Every so often I enjoy exercising my mind by tackling some programming
          challenges.

        <h3>Raspberry Pi Wireless Photo Frame</h3>
        <p>
          I got the idea for this from
          <a
            href="http://www.ofbrooklyn.com/2014/01/2/building-photo-frame-raspberry-pi-motion-detector/"
            >http://www.ofbrooklyn.com/2014/01/2/building-photo-frame-raspberry-pi-motion-detector/</a
          >. I thought that it would be really awesome and a great way to get
          into a Raspberry Pi project and I love showing off my photos. I took
          what he did and got my raspberry pi up and running, tested out a
          sensor and used some of his code and modified some to deal with flickr
          authentication due to the fact that my photos are mostly private.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also just updated it to use play nicer with flickr's update to SSL.
        </p>
